Important notice (2018-09-19)
-----------------------------

This project lacked active development for a long while, and it is very
unlikely that it gets develpment attention in the future. For those
interested in retrieving and processing data from issue tracking repositories
(bug tracking repositories), please consider checking GrimoireLab [1] and
GrimoireLab-Perceval [2]

Description
-----------

Bicho is a command line-based tool used to parse bug/issue tracking
systems. It gets all the information associated with issues and stores
them in a relational database. (It is part of the MetricsGrimoire suite,
which produces data for vizGrimoire to analyze and visualize.)

Currently Bicho supports:
- Bugzilla
- Sourceforge.net (abandoned)
- JIRA
- Launchpad
- GitHub
- Maniphest
- Redmine
- Gerrit
- Allura (unstable)
- Google Code (abandoned)
- Trac


 License
---------

Bicho is licensed under GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or later.

  # python setup.py install

 For the impatients:

  $ bicho --help


 Running Bicho
--------------

This is a quick list of example commands you would run in your terminal to
get bug data from various kinds of bug trackers and capture it in a
database on your local machine. The general format is:

$ bicho --db-user-out=[YOUR DATABASE USERNAME] --db-password-out=[YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD] --db-database-out=[NAME OF DATABASE] -d [DELAY BETWEEN REQUESTS IN NUMBER OF SECONDS] -b [ABBREVIATION FOR BACKEND] -u [BUGTRACKER URL IN QUOTES]

For more guidance, please see doc/UserManual.txt .

It is very important to use a delay. If you run Bicho against big sites
without a delay between bug queries, your IP address could be banned!

Known issues
------------

Newer versions of MySQL server may raise the next error message:
```
Error Code: 1406. Data too long for column
```

To avoid this problem, please update your MySQL configuration removing `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` value from `sql-mode` parameter.

 Credits
--------

Bicho has been originally developed by the GSyC/LibreSoft group at the
Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Mostoles, near Madrid (Spain). It is
part of a wider research on libre software engineering, aiming to gain
knowledge on how libre software is developed and maintained.


 FAQ
----

F1. Bicho crashed with 'UnicodeEncodeError' exception

UnicodeEncodeError appears when it is not possible to write the data in the
database with the encoding used by this one. To avoid that, set your database
to use UTF-8. For instance:

CREATE DATABASE [DB NAME] CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;

F2. What is the database schema?

There is a nice PNG schema in the directory /doc/database .

F3. How can I create a new backend?

Tell us through the contact information above that you want to create a new
backend. We'll try to give you as much information as possible.

Whenever possible, we want to use available APIs. However, some old
bugtrackers used to not have APIs, and even today, some APIs don't give us
all of the information that we want. So a new backend needs to be able to
fall back to HTML scraping and parsing via Beautiful Soup in cases where the
bug tracker's API doesn't exist (maybe an old version of Bugzilla/JIRA/etc.)
or doesn't provide stuff we want.
